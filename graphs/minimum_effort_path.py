    # breakthrough: heapq allows you to follow the path with the lowest height diff because you had the difference between each neighbor to the heap, then heappop only takes the lowest diff from the queue. This means if you are following one path, but suddenly that path's difference is greater than a previous difference (difference meaning difference between the height of one node and the previous node), heappop will switch to the other path and then the algorithm will continue from that new node and follow that path
